# Material Design
An android app demo that showcases the material design components such as buttons and dialog box. There are three activities, `MainActivity.java`, `MaterialButtons.java` and `MaterialDialog.java`. 

## Introduction:
This app includes the following callbacks: `onCreate()`, `onClick()` and some popular methods of AlertDialog$Builder, [`setTitle()`, `show()`, `setIcon()`, `setMessage()`, `setNeutralButton()`, `setNegativeButton()`, `setPositiveButton()` and `setItems()`].

First of all, you have to add material design library into "build.gradle(;app)" file. </br>
![Insert Library](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67506554/103675118-f26b8000-4fad-11eb-8b78-95c7d8c5d307.png) </br></br>
Then, to display the material design components, you have to add material components theme into AndroidManifest.xml</br>
If not, it will only display the android components effect.
